<h1>My Python Projects üöÄ</h1>

<p>Welcome to my repository of Python Projects! This repository showcases a diverse collection of Python projects that I've developed to explore various programming concepts, methods, and libraries.</p>

<h2>Project 1: Guessing Game üé≤</h2>
<p>Guessing Game is a fun Python project where players attempt to guess a secret number between 0 and 100.</p>
<p>It's designed to be beginner-friendly while reinforcing core programming principles such as user input, conditionals, and loops. Also working with random library. </p>

<h3>How to Play üïπÔ∏è</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start the game</strong> by running the Python script named GuessGame.py.</li>
    <li><strong>Guess</strong> a number between 0 and 100.</li>
    <li>Receive feedback on your guess:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"COLD" if your guess is more than 10 away from the secret number.</li>
        <li>"WARM" if your guess is within 10 of the secret number.</li>
        <li>"COLDER" if your guess is farther from the secret number than your previous guess.</li>
        <li>"WARMER" if your guess is closer to the secret number than your previous guess.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Keep guessing</strong> until you find the secret number or decide to quit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project 2: Tic Tac Toe ‚≠ï‚ùå</h2>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where players take turns placing their mark (either X or O) in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>
<p>A beginner-friendly game designed to improve the core programming skills such as user input, conditionals and loops. Also working with lists and matrices to represent the game board.</p>

<h3>How to Play üïπÔ∏è</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start the game</strong> by running the Python script named TicTacToe.py.</li>
    <li>Players take turns entering their moves.</li>
    <li>The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the grid is full.</li>
    <li>Keep playing multiple rounds and see who wins with the maximum score!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game üéÆ</h2>
<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple yet entertaining game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors in an attempt to beat their opponent. </p>
<p>It's a beginner-friendly project designed to reinforce core programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and GUI development using Tkinter.</p>

<h3>How to Play üïπÔ∏è</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start the game</strong> by running the Python script in the folder RockPaperScissors named RockPaperScissors.py.</li>
    <li>Click on the image representing your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.</li>
    <li>After making your choice, the computer will randomly select its move.</li>
    <li>The game will display the result: win, lose, or tie.</li>
    <li>Keep playing to see if you can outsmart the computer!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project 4: Age and Day Calculator üìÖ</h2>
<p>The Age and Day Calculator is a Python application designed to calculate a person's age based on their birthdate and determine the day of the week they were born on. </p>
<p>This project focuses on GUI development, date manipulation, user input handling, and basic error handling in Python.</p>

<h3>How to Use üìù</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Run the Application:</strong> Execute the Python script named AgeDayCalculator.py.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter Personal Information:</strong> Input your name, birth year, birth month, and birth date into the designated fields.</li>
    <li><strong>Submit Information:</strong> Click the "Submit" button to calculate your age and determine the day of the week you were born on.</li>
    <li><strong>View Results:</strong> The application will display your age and the day of the week you were born on in an aesthetically pleasing format.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project 5: Friendship Test Application ü§ù</h2>

<p>The Friendship Test is a Python application designed to evaluate how well you know your friend by comparing your answers to a set of questions. The questions include favorite color, birthdate, favorite movie, hobby, and favorite destination. The application provides instant feedback on your guesses and calculates your score based on the number of correct answers.</p>
<p>This project mainly focuses on GUI Development with Tkinter, user input handling, data handling, conditional statements, Text-to-Speech Integration using pyttx3 library and importing files as modules/packages.</p>

<h3>How to Use üïπÔ∏è</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Run the Python script in the folder FriendshipTest named <strong>Friendshiptest.py</strong>.</li>
    <li>Enter your answers for each question.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>"Submit"</strong> button on each form to see the results.</li>
    <li>Receive immediate feedback on your guesses and your overall score.</li>
    <li>Based on your score, get a message indicating the level of friendship between you and your friend.</li>
  <li>Enjoy testing your friendship and see how well you know each other!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project 6: Zodiac Sign Finder üåü</h2>
<p>The Zodiac Sign Finder is a Python application designed to determine a person's zodiac sign based on their birth month and date. It provides users with a simple interface to input their birth details and view their corresponding zodiac sign.</p>
<p>This project focuses on GUI interface using Tkinter, image intergration with Tkinter, dictionaries, tuples and text-to-speech functionality using pyttx3 library.</p>
<h3>How to Use üîÑ</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Run the Application:</strong> Execute the Python script in the folder zodiac named Zodiac_sign.py.</li>
    <li>Enter your birth month in the provided text field.</li>
    <li>Enter your birth date in the respective text field.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>"Submit" </strong>button to find out your zodiac sign.</li>
    <li>The application will display your zodiac sign along with a corresponding image.</li>
</ul>
