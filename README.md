<h2 id="guessing-game">Project 1: Guessing Game 🎲</h2>
<p>Guessing Game is a fun Python project where players attempt to guess a secret number between 0 and 100.</p>
<p>It's designed to be beginner-friendly while reinforcing core programming principles such as user input, conditionals, and loops. Also working with random library. </p>

<h3>How to Play 🕹️</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start the game</strong> by running the Python script named GuessGame.py.</li>
    <li><strong>Guess</strong> a number between 0 and 100.</li>
    <li>Receive feedback on your guess:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"COLD" if your guess is more than 10 away from the secret number.</li>
        <li>"WARM" if your guess is within 10 of the secret number.</li>
        <li>"COLDER" if your guess is farther from the secret number than your previous guess.</li>
        <li>"WARMER" if your guess is closer to the secret number than your previous guess.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Keep guessing</strong> until you find the secret number or decide to quit.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tic-tac-toe">Project 2: Tic Tac Toe ⭕❌</h2>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where players take turns placing their mark (either X or O) in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>
<p>A beginner-friendly game designed to improve the core programming skills such as user input, conditionals and loops. Also working with lists and matrices to represent the game board.</p>

<h3>How to Play 🕹️</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start the game</strong> by running the Python script named TicTacToe.py.</li>
    <li>Players take turns entering their moves.</li>
    <li>The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the grid is full.</li>
    <li>Keep playing multiple rounds and see who wins with the maximum score!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blackjack-game">Project 3: Blackjack Game 🃏</h2>
<p>Welcome to my Blackjack game project! This Python script simulates the popular casino card game Blackjack, also known as 21. In this game, players compete against the dealer to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.</p>
<p>A game designed to improve the core programming skills such as object oriented programming and error handling.</p>

<h3>How to Play 🕹️</h3>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Start the Game:</strong> Run the Python script named <code>Blackjack.py</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Place Your Bet:</strong> Enter the number of chips you want to bet at the prompt.</li>
        <li><strong>Receive Your Cards:</strong> You'll be dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer receives one face-up card and one face-down card.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Your Move:</strong> Decide whether to hit (take another card) or stand (keep your current hand) based on your hand value and the dealer's visible card.</li>
        <li><strong>Reach 21 or Closest Value:</strong> Try to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. If your hand value exceeds 21, you bust and lose the round.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat the Dealer:</strong> Compare your hand value to the dealer's hand value. If your hand value is higher than the dealer's (without busting), you win chips. If the dealer's hand value is higher, you lose chips. If the values are equal, it's a push, and you keep your chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Play Again:</strong> After each round, you have the option to play another hand or exit the game.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="rock-paper-scissors">Project 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮</h2>
<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple yet entertaining game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors in an attempt to beat their opponent. </p>
<p>It's a beginner-friendly project designed to reinforce core programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and GUI development using Tkinter.</p>

<h3>How to Play 🕹️</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start the game</strong> by running the Python script in the folder RockPaperScissors named RockPaperScissors.py.</li>
    <li>Click on the image representing your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.</li>
    <li>After making your choice, the computer will randomly select its move.</li>
    <li>The game will display the result: win, lose, or tie.</li>
    <li>Keep playing to see if you can outsmart the computer!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="age-day-calculator">Project 5: Age and Day Calculator 📅</h2>
<p>The Age and Day Calculator is a Python application designed to calculate a person's age based on their birthdate and determine the day of the week they were born on. </p>
<p>This project focuses on GUI development, date manipulation, user input handling, and basic error handling in Python.</p>

<h3>How to Use 📝</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Run the Application:</strong> Execute the Python script named AgeDayCalculator.py.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter Personal Information:</strong> Input your name, birth year, birth month, and birth date into the designated fields.</li>
    <li><strong>Submit Information:</strong> Click the "Submit" button to calculate your age and determine the day of the week you were born on.</li>
    <li><strong>View Results:</strong> The application will display your age and the day of the week you were born on in an aesthetically pleasing format.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="friendship-test">Project 6: Friendship Test Application 🤝</h2>

<p>The Friendship Test is a Python application designed to evaluate how well you know your friend by comparing your answers to a set of questions. The questions include favorite color, birthdate, favorite movie, hobby, and favorite destination. The application provides instant feedback on your guesses and calculates your score based on the number of correct answers.</p>
<p>This project mainly focuses on GUI Development with Tkinter, user input handling, data handling, conditional statements, Text-to-Speech Integration using pyttx3 library and importing files as modules/packages.</p>

<h3>How to Use 📝</h3>
